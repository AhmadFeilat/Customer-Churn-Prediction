# Customer Churn Prediction
- I am building a system that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay with the telecom company. 
- I am using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for our prediction.
- The data is preprocessed using Label Encoding and Standard Scaling, and to handle the class imbalance.
- I applied the SMOTE technique.
- The models are trained and evaluated using various metrics.
